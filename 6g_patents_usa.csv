In various embodiments, this involves provisioning computer hosts including a first computer host, a second computer host and a group of computer hosts. In those embodiments, this includes provisioning a server management software on the first computer host; creating a node pool using the group of computer hosts; provisioning a distributed unit (DU) on the second computer host; and configuring a RAN using the DU.",2026-02-01
12432614,USPTO,Techniques about converting time-domain fronthaul data to frequency-domain fronthaul data within a distributed antenna system,2025-09-30,Outdoor Wireless Networks LLC,"Techniques for reducing downlink data and/or uplink data transported in a distributed antenna system (DAS) are provided. Time domain data is transformed into a frequency domain. In the DAS, on a PRB-by-PRB basis, whether each of frequency-domain downlink digital data and frequency-domain uplink digital data comprise a meaningful signal is determined. Each of the frequency-domain downlink digital data and the frequency-domain uplink digital data comprising valid PRBs are subsequently transported in the DAS. Other techniques are disclosed for utilizing O-RAN user plane messages and corresponding O-RAN control plane messages in fronthaul transport of a distributed antenna system (DAS) to reduce bandwidth consumption and simplify management of the DAS. Bandwidth consumption in the fronthaul transport of the DAS is diminished by only transporting IQ data having a valid signal.",2026-02-01
